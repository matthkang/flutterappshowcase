# Showcase for Flutter App

## A Flutter app that is developed for iOS, Android and Web for high school students to organize their college admission data.

## Architecture

The application is based on Flutter_Bloc to organize the UI, data, and logic into seperate layers

All the screen are made with flutter dart language, and the data is stored on both the local device and remote service (Supabase)
